## Motivation

Due to well-known tournaments, emerging talent, and coverage of controversies by popular media, tennis has become increasingly popular. We aim to understand the trends of menâ€™s tennis matches at the four major championships (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) to provide insights into this dynamic and evolving sport, catering to fans, analysts, and industry stakeholders.

## Related Work

Our team was inspired by Jeff Sackman's [Match Charting Project](https://www.tennisabstract.com/charting/meta.html), which many broadcasters and analysts rely on for understanding pro matches. Our project aims to further expand on this work and visualize player and match information.

## Initial Questions



## Data Sources:

There exists a Github [database](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) with all of the matches information, alongside match statistics and player information in CSV form by year. The compiled data is mostly complete from 1985 to the present, with intermittent rankings from 1973 to 1984. 

In addition, there is a page of suspension/doping cases of players that can be webscraped.

## Planned Analyses and Visualizations:

Examples of potential analyses and visualization (but are not limited to):

Geographic Information Systems (GIS): map and visualize player information (home countries)
Visualize/analyze trends of winners/matches over multiple years
Statistic Analysis: Rankings by score, player age information; Compare seed scores to final score
Look at which tournament a player/country is winning in more
Track players and their performances with suspensions (doping)

## Data Dictionary

## Doping Cases
As our secondary analysis focuses on the impact of doping sanctions on player performance in professional tennis, we collected data from both the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and Wikipedia to create a comprehensive dataset of doping cases.
