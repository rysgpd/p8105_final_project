## Data Sources:

There exists a Github database with all of the matches information, alongside match statistics and player information in CSV form by year. In addition, there is a page of suspension/doping cases of players that can be webscraped.

## Planned Analyses and Visualizations:

Examples of potential analyses and visualization (but are not limited to):

Geographic Information Systems (GIS): map and visualize player information (home countries)
Visualize/analyze trends of winners/matches over multiple years
Statistic Analysis: Rankings by score, player age information; Compare seed scores to final score
Look at which tournament a player/country is winning in more
Track players and their performances with suspensions (doping)
