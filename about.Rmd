## Data Sources:

There exists a Github [database](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) with all of the matches information, alongside match statistics and player information in CSV form by year. The compiled data is mostly complete from 1985 to the present, with intermittent rankings from 1973 to 1984. 

In addition, there is a page of suspension/doping cases of players that can be webscraped.

## Planned Analyses and Visualizations:

Examples of potential analyses and visualization (but are not limited to):

Geographic Information Systems (GIS): map and visualize player information (home countries)
Visualize/analyze trends of winners/matches over multiple years
Statistic Analysis: Rankings by score, player age information; Compare seed scores to final score
Look at which tournament a player/country is winning in more
Track players and their performances with suspensions (doping)

## Data Dictionary
- tourney_id: a unique identifier for each tournament, such as 2020-888. The exact formats are borrowed from several different sources, so while the first four characters are always the year, the rest of the ID doesn't follow a predictable structure.
- tourney_name: name of tournament
- surface: type of court surface
- draw_size: number of players in the draw, often rounded up to the nearest power of 2. (For instance, a tournament with 28 players may be shown as 32.)
- tourney_level: For men: 'G' = Grand Slams, 'M' = Masters 1000s, 'A' = other tour-level events, 'C' = Challengers, 'S' = Satellites/ITFs, 'F' = Tour finals and other season-ending events, and 'D' = Davis Cup 
  - Others, eventually for both genders: 'E' = exhibition (events not sanctioned by the tour, though the definitions can be ambiguous), 'J' = juniors, and 'T' = team tennis, which does yet appear anywhere in the dataset but will at some point.
- tourney_date: eight digits, YYYYMMDD, usually the Monday of the tournament week.
- match_num: a match-specific identifier. Often starting from 1, sometimes counting down from 300, and sometimes arbitrary. 
- winner_id: the player_id used in this repo for the winner of the match
- winner_seed
- winner_entry: 'WC' = wild card, 'Q' = qualifier, 'LL' = lucky loser, 'PR' = protected ranking, 'ITF' = ITF entry, and there are a few others that are occasionally used.
- winner_name
