Group Members:

Laura Henze (lah2231), Rebecca Shyu (rs4338), HsiYu Chen (hc3448), Stacey Dai (sd3730), and Vaiju Raja (vr2576)

Tenatative Project Title:

Challengers: P8105 Edition

Motivation:

With Challengers coming out this year, tennis has become incredibly popular. There have also been many public controversies, especially with Jannik Sinner and his recent doping case that have drawn more people to tennis as well. We want to understand the trends of ATP (menâ€™s tennis) matches at the four grand slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open).

Intended Final Products:

A descriptive report of male tennis players and their performances in the grand slams within the past 5 years. This will be displayed as a website on Github and will be screencasted with explanations.

Anticipated Data Sources:

There exists a Github database with all of the matches information, alongside match statistics and player information in CSV form by year. In addition, there is a page of suspension/doping cases of players that can be webscraped.

Planned Analyses and Visualizations:

Examples of potential analyses and visualization (but are not limited to):

Geographic Information Systems (GIS): map and visualize player information (home countries)
Visualize/analyze trends of winners/matches over multiple years
Statistic Analysis: Rankings by score, player age information; Compare seed scores to final score
Look at which tournament a player/country is winning in more
Track players and their performances with suspensions (doping)
Potential Coding Challenges:

Potential challenges may include missing data, match nuances from COVID years, and cleaning/pivoting the match information correctly to winners and losers.
